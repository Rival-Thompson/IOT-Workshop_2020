# IOT Workshop - by Rival Thompson #

## Contents of repository ##

This repository contains a set of code samples and slides matching the workshop I give about IOT.

The workshop is contained in 4 sessions.

- Getting started with Arduino
- Lets communicate
- Lets make a network
- Lets automate together

Each of these sessions tackles a specific skill. These skills are needed to make a fully self made home automation system from scratch to almost finished.
